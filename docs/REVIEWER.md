Review this change as a senior engineer.

1) Summarize what changed (features added/removed, key files).
2) Check each change for: design, correctness, performance, and security risks.
3) For every issue, explain briefly and propose a concrete fix (cite file/line if possible).
4) Cross-check design vs implementation:
   - Read AGENTS.md and relevant docs/ files.
   - Note any deviations between documented behavior and actual code.
   - Raise issues if any bad design patterns are found. Revise for better architectural patterns.
   - Say whether to update docs or update code.

Finish with a short verdict (✔️ approve / ❌ needs changes) using bullet points only.
Focus only on meaningful issues — avoid style nitpicks.
